  <h2>My recent favorite BOOK!</h2>
  <hr />

  <!-- Jottings --------------------------------------------------------->
  <h5>Jottings</h5>
  <p>
    Actually I haven't been reading for a considerable amount of time. Admittedly,
    this might be the first book I read (except for textbooks) in years.
    Here's the thing, I am currently doing internships in Hong Kong this summer
    and I am always keeping my eyes on screen both during work and after work (playing
    video games). My eyes are really tired and I need to find something to relax
    without phones, laptops, or any other electronic devices. Reading books quickly
    came across me. I have been hearing about this book for a long time and I decided
    to give it a try.
