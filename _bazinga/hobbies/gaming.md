  <h3>Gaming</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
      I'm sooooo passionate about games and have been playing them since primary school. I am thrilled to share some of the best games I've played over the years, and I hope you find them as enjoyable as I did!
  </p>

  <h4>My Favorite Games</h4>

  <h5>League of Legends</h5>
  <p>
      I've been playing LoL since primary school. At that time, I have to sneak out to play it because my parents forbade me from playing video games. I felt bad about it, but I didn't regret it at all. I believe that playing video games is an amazing way to relax and meet new friends.

  <h5>Elden Ring</h5>
  <p>
      One of the most immersive open-world experiences I've ever had. Not extremely challenging but very rewarding. I highly recommend it to anyone even you are not a fan of the genre. This is very beginner-friendly according to me.
