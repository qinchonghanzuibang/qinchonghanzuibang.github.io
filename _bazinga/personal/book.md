  <!-- Jottings --------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Jottings</h4>
  <p>
    Actually I haven't been reading for a considerable amount of time. Admittedly,
    this might be the first book I read (except for textbooks) in years.
    Here's the thing, I am currently doing internships in Hong Kong this summer
    and I am always keeping my eyes on screen both during work and after work (playing
    video games). My eyes are really tired and I need to find something to relax
    without phones, laptops, or any other electronic devices. Reading books quickly
    came across me. I have been hearing about this book for a long time and I decided
    to give it a try.

  <!-- Reflection -------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Spoiler Alert:</strong>
    I will be discussing certain parts of the plot of the book in this section.
    If you haven't read the book yet and plan to read it, I suggest you skip this
    section. Christopher's journey begins with the investigation of a neighbor's dog's death, but it quickly unfolds into a deeper quest for understanding and self-discovery. His logical approach to life, reliance on patterns, and difficulty interpreting social cues highlight the challenges faced by individuals who perceive the world differently. Through Christopher's interactions, the novel examines the impact of secrets and lies within familial relationships, emphasizing the importance of honesty and communication.​
  </p>

  <p>
    While the narrative provides valuable insight into Christopher's mind, it's important to acknowledge critiques regarding the portrayal of autism. Some readers and critics have expressed concerns about the accuracy and sensitivity of the representation, noting that the novel may reinforce certain stereotypes and overlook the diverse experiences of individuals on the autism spectrum. ​
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Despite these critiques, the novel's strength lies in its ability to foster empathy and challenge readers to consider perspectives different from their own. By immersing us in Christopher's world, Haddon encourages a deeper understanding of the nuances of human behavior and the significance of embracing neurodiversity.​
