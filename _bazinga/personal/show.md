  <h3>Recommendation on something to watch!</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I enjoy watching TV shows and movies. Here are some of my favorite ones.
  </p>
  <h5>TV Shows</h5>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Modern Family</strong>
        <p class="ml-0 mb-1">I am pretty sure that this is the <strong>first</strong> TV show I have watched since I was a kid! At least the first one I remember.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Big Bang Theory</strong>
        <p class="ml-0 mb-1">I cannot even recall how many times I have watched this show from the beginning to the end. <strong>GOAT!</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes</a></strong>
        <p class="ml-0 mb-1">It sometimes got me scared to go to sleep at night.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Simpsons</strong>
        <p class="ml-0 mb-1">Always a good laugh.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Person of Interest</strong>
        <p class="ml-0 mb-1">I am <strong>currently</strong> watching the second season. I might consider writing a full review of this show.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Better Call Saul</strong>
        <p class="ml-0 mb-1">Many prefer Breaking Bad, but I prefer this one.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>
        <p class="ml-0 mb-1">Great show, but I prefer the books (A Song of Ice and Fire).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
